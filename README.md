## Launching the Portfolio in local environment
The portfolio is still in its early stages and it runs locally. To run the portfolio:

1) Clone the repo to your preferred directory on the command line and change into the project root directory `cd portfolio-page`
2) Install dependencies with `npm i` (or yarn if you prefer)
3) Run the compiler build script `npm run build`
4) Open index.html in your browser and wallah!
